RGBDS (Rednex Game Boy Development System) is a free assembler/linker package
for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. It consists of:

  - rgbasm  (assembler)
  - rgblink (linker)
  - rgblib  (library manager)
  - rgbfix  (checksum/header fixer)

rgbds-linux is a fork of the original RGBDS which aims to make the programs
more like other UNIX tools.
