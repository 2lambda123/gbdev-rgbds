RGBDS (Rednex Game Boy Development System) is a free assembler/linker package
for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. It consists of:

  - rgbasm  (assembler)
  - rgblink (linker)
  - rgblib  (library manager)
  - rgbfix  (checksum/header fixer)

rgbds-linux is a fork of the original RGBDS which aims to make the programs
more like other UNIX tools.


  Building RGBDS
================

To build the programs on a UNIX or UNIX-like system, just run in your terminal:

  make

There is no install target -- just copy the binaries (rgbasm, rgbfix, rgblib,
and rgblink) to a folder in your $PATH.

To build the documentation, use the man target:

  make man

This will create manual pages (rgbasm.0, rgbfix.0, rgblib.0, and rgblink.0)
which can be read with a pager such as more(1):

  more rgbasm.0

There are no Windows installation instructions at this time.
