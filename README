What is RGBDS-linux?
====================

RGBDS-linux is a revival of the "Rednex GameBoy Development System" (RGBDS),
a set of tools that allow you to compile your own games and programs for the
Nintendo GameBoy.

RGBDS consists of an assembler (rgbdasm), a linker (xlink), a library manager
(xlib), and a tool for producing valid GameBoy ROM images (rgbfix).

I _think_ this is the development history of RGBDS/ASMotor:

	* Around 1997, Carsten Sorensen (AKA SurfSmurf) writes ASMotor as a
	  general-purpose assembler/linker system for DOS/Win32

	* Around 1999, Justin Lloyd (AKA Otaku no Zoku) adapts ASMotor to
	  read and produce Z80 assembly/machine code, and releases this
	  version as RGBDS.

This (RGBDS-linux) is an adaption of RGBDS intended for use on GNU/Linux
systems. In short, we provide a project layout and user interface that is more
familiar to GNU/Linux users. Note that we make no attempt to retain backwards
compatibility with the original RGBDS, or even the possibility to run the
programs on DOS/Win32.

Also expect improvements and bugfixes to make their way into the source code.
